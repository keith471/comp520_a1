# QUESTIONS

## For class

1. Where do we require new lines?
2. How about function calls? print can take an expression but read shouldn't be able to.
Do we want our parser to catch this?
3. Does a while loop have to have a body?
    - right now you allow it not to
4. Does an if statement have to have a body?
    - right now you allow it not to
5. Indentation for if/else blocks/while loops?

## Just for me
1. Line ends are a pain with bison. Have to match them even if they are not required.
